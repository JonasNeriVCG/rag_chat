    "subject": "Brewer\u2019s spent yeast (BSY) mannoproteins have been reported to possess thickening and emulsifying properties. The commercial interest in yeast mannoproteins might be boosted considering the consolidation of their properties supported by structure/function relationships. This work aimed to attest the use of extracted BSY mannoproteins as a clean label and vegan source of ingredients for the replacement of food additives and protein from animal sources. To achieve this, structure/function relationships were performed by isolating polysaccharides with distinct structural features from BSY, either by using alkaline extraction (mild treatment) or subcritical water extraction (SWE) using microwave technology (hard treatment), and assessment of their emulsifying properties. Alkaline extractions solubilized mostly highly branched mannoproteins (N-linked type; 75%) and glycogen (25%), while SWE solubilized mannoproteins with short mannan chains (O-linked type; 55%) and (14)- and (13)-linked glucans, 33 and 12%, respectively. Extracts with high protein content yielded the most stable emulsions obtained by hand shaking, while the extracts composed of short chain mannans and -glucans yielded the best emulsions by using ultraturrax stirring. -Glucans and O-linked mannoproteins were found to contribute to emulsion stability by preventing Ostwald ripening. When applied in mayonnaise model emulsions, BSY extracts presented higher stability and yet similar texture properties as the reference emulsifiers. When used in a mayonnaise formulation, the BSY extracts were also able to replace egg yolk and modified starch (E1422) at 1/3 of their concentration. This shows that BSY alkali soluble mannoproteins and subcritical water extracted -glucans can be used as replacers of animal protein and additives in sauces.",
