    "subject": "Over the years, synthetic biology has been growing with the use of engineered yeast strains for the production of sustainable ingredients to meet global healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing and environmental challenges. However, as seen from the brewing industry perspective, these processes generate a substantial amount of spent yeast that contains high nutritional value related to its high protein content, showing its potential to be used as an alternative protein source. Taking into account the rising demand for protein because of the growth in the global population, the present study aims to produce peptide-rich extracts by different potentially scalable and sustainable methodologies in a circular economy approach for the food and nutraceutical industries. The results demonstrated that extraction from genetically modified strains allowed the production of extracts with an excellent nutritional profile and low molecular weight peptides. Furthermore, autolysis was shown to be a potential sustainable approach for this production, though other green metrics need to be explored in order to establish this process at an industrial level.",
