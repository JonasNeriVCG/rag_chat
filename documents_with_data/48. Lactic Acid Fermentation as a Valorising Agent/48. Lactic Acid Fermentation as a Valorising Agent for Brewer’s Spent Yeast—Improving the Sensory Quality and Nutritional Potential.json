    "subject": "Brewer\u2019s spent yeast (BSY) is one of the brewing industry\u2019s most plentiful side-streams. Abundant, low-cost and high in nutrients, it has great potential for application in food technology and human nutrition. With the ever-increasing interest in sustainability, waste reduction and circular food systems, the use of BSY as a novel food ingredient may be the route to add exponential value while reducing the environmental impact. However, negative flavour characteristics and high amounts of alcohol severely limit the current applications of BSY. This study explores the use of processing involving lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation technology as a means of improving BSY quality characteristics and examines the effects of this process on the chemical, nutritional and sensory characteristics of BSY. The results reveal that BSY is a suitable substrate for LAB fermentation, successfully supporting the growth of Lactobacillus amylovorus FST 2.11. Compared to the unfermented BSY (CBSY), fermentation significantly reduced the perceptible bitterness of the BSY as detected by a sensory panel, from 6.0  2.8 units to 0.9  0.7 units, respectively. Fermented BSY (PBSY) had enhanced sour and fruity flavours, and a variety of other volatile compounds and metabolites were determined. Protein profiles showed significant protein degradation, and free amino acid levels were greatly increased following fermentation, from 2.8  0.2 g/100 g to 10.5  0.4 g/100 g, respectively. Protein quality was high, with the CBSY and PBSY providing well over the required level (>100%) of essential amino acids per gram protein, with the exception of sulphur amino acids (98%). Major physical differences were observed using scanning electron microscopy. This study concludes that LAB fermentation positively affects the sensory and nutritional characteristics of BSY and can aid in the incorporation of brewer\u2019s spent yeast into foods for human consumption.",
