    "subject": "Yeast biomass, a brewery by-product of the world’s substantial alcohol beverage industry, finds successful applications in the fodder industry and food additive production. This is attributed to its rich nutritional profile that comprises high protein and vitamin content. Nonetheless, in small-scale breweries, yeast slurries present a significant challenge, as the quantities obtained are insufficient to attract the attention of the food industry. The disposal of yeast contributes substantially to the organic load of wastewater (approximately 40%) and elevates water consumption (3–6 hL/hL of beer), consequently escalating production costs and environmental impact. In recent years, diverse potential applications of products derived from yeast biomass have emerged, encompassing the substitution of sera in cell culture media, the fortification of animal feed with vitamins and selenium, the utilization of beta-glucan in low-fat food products, and the development of functional foods incorporating yeast-derived peptides. These peptides exhibit the potential to safeguard the gastric mucosa, prevent hypertension, and address neurodegenerative disorders. The rising demand for value-added products derived from yeast underscores the potential profitability of processing yeast from small breweries. Due to the high equipment costs associated with yeast biomass fractionation, the establishment of specialized facilities in collaboration with multiple small breweries appears to be the most optimal solution.",
