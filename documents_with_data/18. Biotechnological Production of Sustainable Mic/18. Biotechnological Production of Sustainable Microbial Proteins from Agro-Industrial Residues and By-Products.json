    "subject": "Microbial proteins, i.e., single-cell proteins or microbial biomass, can be cultivated for food and animal feed due to their high protein content and the fact that they represent a rich source of carbohydrates, minerals, fats, vitamins, and amino acids. Another advantage of single-cell proteins is their rapid production due to the growth rate of microorganisms and the possibility of using agro-industrial waste, residues and by-products for production through this renewable technology. Agro-industrial residues and by-products represent materials obtained from various processes in agriculture and agriculture-related industries; taking into account their composition and characteristics, as well as vast amounts, they have an enormous potential to generate sustainable bioproducts, such as microbial proteins. This review aims to summarize contemporary scientific research related to the production of microbial proteins on various agro-industrial residues and by-products, as well as to emphasize the current state of production of single-cell proteins and the importance of their production to ease the food crisis and support sustainable development.",
